# Library project

In this project, we implement several lessons that we have learned on javascript, html, and css. 

#### Javascript
The topics that we practiced in this project are:

* Object constructors with properties and methods, instantiated with the 'new' keyword. 
* Adding and removing elements from an array with the array functions '.push' and '.splice'
* Using the inputs of a form as variables (selecting elements from the DOM)
* Iterating over the elements of an array and perform an action on each of them with the 'forEach' method.
* Creating elements to the DOM and appending children to them, and modifying their text contents. 
* Using the short version of 'if statements' with ['if true' ? 'this' : 'else']
* Adding event listeners to buttons ('click') and forms ('submit')



#### HTML
The topics that we practiced in this project are:

* HTML forms with labels, inputs and submit buttons. 
* A modal container to use as a dialog 
* Adding empty containers to which add children later with JS


#### CSS
The topics that we practiced in this project are:

* selectors and form styling 
* hiding elements with display = 'none'
